# WebSocket

Firebot hosts a local Websocket API that developers can use to get data from Firebot.

- The API is hosted on port **7472**. All endpoints have the root **ws://localhost:7472**
- All responses are in JSON.
- Don't forget that Firebot must be running for the API to be available.

  "data": []
}
```
