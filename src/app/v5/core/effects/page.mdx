# Effects
The effects available in Firebot represent the *cool* stuff that can happen in response to things like a command or an event. There are a lot of effects available, and even more ways to combine them in unique ways to create a memoriable experience for your viewers.

## Effects List
Effects are contained within an effects list, and some effects can contain additional effect list(s). Each effects list has an unique ID, and can control features like which [Effect Queue](/effect-queues) to run the effects within. [Preset effect lists](/preset-effect-lists) are bespoke effect lists that can accept custom parameters. These can be very helpful for designing and testing larger collections of effects.
