## Can my mods access my Firebot app?
No. However, there are three alternatives that might suit your needs:
1. In System Commands you will find commands with which commands, quotes and currency can be managed. 
2. You can create advanced Custom Commands with Effects to allow them to alter data in your app.  
3. You can have your mods run their own Firebot, and let them create a setup which you can then import into your Firebot.
